# bay_club_water_predicter
Recently when I was swimming at bay club we refilled water at a water bottle refueler. We tried to guess that amount of water bootles that the machine filled.

So I created a water predictor at bay club so I made a model with the data.

Every day we went  swimming there we took a picture of the number of water.

The machine counts the amount of bootles filled and we thought it was intresting so me and my Dad went to start taking pictures of the number of water bootles filled.

On week 1 we saw that it filled 166773 water bottles.

On week 2 we saw that it filled 167908 water bottles

On week 3  we saw that it filled 169356 water bottles
## What we did
Here are the pictures we took:

I used scikit learn to predict the numbers and plotted it on a graph.
I used a linear reggresion model to predict the numbers.
